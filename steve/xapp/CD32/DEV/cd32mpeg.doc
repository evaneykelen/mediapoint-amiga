   NAME
       CMD_FLUSH -- cancel all pending CMD_WRITE requests

   FUNCION
       CMD_FLUSH aborts all CMD_WRITE requests in progress or queued.
       This call will also flush any decoder buffers.  However, the current
       play state will not be changed.  For the best visual results, the
	currently executing MPEGCMD_PLAY command should be aborted, or the
	device should be in a paused state.  Otherwise, undesirable video
	or audio artifacts may occur due to decoder underdlow.

   INPUTS
       mn_ReplyPort - pointer to message port that receives I/O request
                      if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear
       io_Device    - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from
                      I/O block set by) OpenDevice function
       io_Unit      - unit number to reset
       io_Command   - command number for CMD_FLUSH
       io_Flags     - flags, must be cleared if not use:
                      IOF_QUICK - (CLEAR) reply I/O request

   OUTPUTS
       None

cd32mpeg.device/CMD_RESET                           cd32mpeg.device/CMD_RESET

   NAME
       CMD_RESET -- restore device to a known state

   FUNCTION

cd32mpeg.device/CMD_WRITE                           cd32mpeg.device/CMD_WRITE

   NAME
       CMD_WRITE -- normal I/O entry point

   FUNCTION
       CMD_WRITE is used to send data to the MPEG device driver when playing
       back an MPEG stream using the MPEGCMD_PLAY command.

       Depending on the capabilities of the MPEG device driver, the data
       may be packs from an ISO System stream, or may be raw video and/or
       audio streams.

	The amount of data the needs to be written to the device depends on
	the playback mode being used.  For normal rate playback, it would be
	a good idea to keep a large amount of data queued up in order to
	avoid video or audio glitches.

	When sending MPEG system streams to the device, each block of data
	sent by the CMD_WRITE command MUST correspond to exactly one pack
	of data.

   INPUTS
       mn_ReplyPort - pointer to message port that receives I/O request
                      if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear
       io_Device    - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from
                      I/O block set by) OpenDevice function
       io_Unit      - unit number to queue data for
       io_Command   - command number for CMD_WRITE
       io_Flags     - flags, must be cleared if not use:
                      IOF_QUICK - (CLEAR) reply I/O request
       io_Data      - Pointer to a data buffer that contains valid data
	io_Length    - Amount of data pointed to by io_Data.
       iomr_Clockxxxx - A timestamp associated with this data segment.  This
                      is typically the PTS value if this data segment was
                      part of a system stream.
       iomr_MPEGFlags - Status information regarding this data:
                      MPEGFLAGF_VALIDCLK - io_PTSxxxx contains a valid
                                           timestamp associated with
                                           this data.

   OUTPUTS
       io_Error     - If non-zero, then an error of some kind occurred.
                      See <exec/errors.h> and <devices/mpeg.h> for more
                      details.

   NOTES
       For efficient operation, it will be best to keep a certain minimum
       amount of data queued up at any given time, otherwise gaps or glitches
	may appear in the audio and/or video output.   Approximately 64k for
	video and 16k for audio is a good starting point.

cd32mpeg.device/GetSCR                                 cd32mpeg.device/GetSCR

   NAME
       GetSCR -- Get the current System Clock Reference value.

   SYNOPSIS
       clockValue = GetSCR()
       D0

       ULONG GetSCR(struct Unit *unit);

   FUNCTION
       This call is used to get the MPEG System Clock Reference from a MPEG
       device driver.  This is usually used for synchronizing one device
       driver to another.

   INPUTS
	unit	     - The value in the io_Unit field of the IO request
		       returned by OpenDevice.

   OUTPUTS
       clockValue   - The lower 32 bits of the SCR.  The MPEG clock is
                      specified to be 33 bits, but we only use 32 bits of
                      that clock.

   NAME
       MPEGCMD_PLAY -- Start decoding a MPEG stream

   FUNCTION
       MPEGCMD_PLAY tells the MPEG device driver to begin standard rate MPEG
       playback.

	The MPEG stream data must be supplied via the CMD_WRITE device
	command.  If you are playing back MPEG from a CD-ROM, you may wish to
	use the MPEGCMD_PLAYLSN command.

	This command currently will run forever until it is aborted.  Future
       versions of the device driver may automatically detect the end of an
	MPEG stream.

   INPUTS
       mn_ReplyPort - pointer to message port that receives I/O request
                      if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear

cd32mpeg.device/MPEGCMD_PLAYLSN               cd32mpeg.device/MPEGCMD_PLAYLSN

   NAME
       MPEGCMD_PLAY -- Start playing a MPEG stream from CD.

   FUNCTION
       MPEGCMD_PLAY tells the MPEG device driver to begin standard rate MPEG
       playback from CD using cd.device.

	The command will not return until it has played io_Length number of
	sectors or either "end" of the stream is reached.  Play may also be
	aborted using AbortIO().

	Due to the nature of MPEG video, you MUST supply the position of
	the start of the MPEG stream you are playing in iomr_Arg2.  This is
	because the current decoder must read the MPEG Video Sequence
	Header to dertmine parameters such as picture size, frame rate, etc.
	Once this has been done, the device will seek to the position given
	in iomr_Offset.

	If the current Scan speed setting is less than zero, then the device
	will start scanning from the end of the sequence once it has located
	the sequence header.

   INPUTS
       mn_ReplyPort - pointer to message port that receives I/O request
                      if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear
       io_Device    - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from

       iomr_StreamType  - Set to one of MPEGSTREAM_VIDEO, MPEGSTREAM_AUDIO
                      or MPEGSTREAM_SYSTEM depending on the stream type.
	iomr_Data    - unused.
	iomr_Offset  - Logical sector number to start playback at.
	iomr_Length  - Number of sectors to play
	iomr_Arg1    - Sector size to use with cd.device
	iomr_Arg2    - The real beginning of the stream on the disk.

   OUTPUTS
       io_Error     - If non-zero, then an error of some kind occured.
                      See <exec/errors.h> and <devices/mpeg.h> for more

cd32mpeg.device/MPEGCMD_SEARCH                 cd32mpeg.device/MPEGCMD_SEARCH

   NAME
       MPEGCMD_SEARCH -- Set forward or reverse search mode and/or search
			  for a video I-frame.

   FUNCTION
	MPEGCMD_SEARCH is used to either set the forward or reverse search
	mode, or to do a one-shot search for a video I-frame.

	The iomr_Arg1 field of the IO request should be set to a non-zero
	value to enable search mode.  If you are playing an MPEG stream
	using the MPEGCMD_PLAYLSN command, iomr_Arg1 should be set to the
	number of sectors to skip after each I-frame is found.  This value
	may be positive or negative.  If you are using the MPEGCMD_PLAY
	command, this value should be a 1.

	If you would like the device to search for the next I-frame and then
	enter pause mode, you may set the MPEGF_ONESHOT flag in the
	iomr_MPEGFlags field of the IO request structure.  In this case, the
	IO request will not come back until the frame has been found and the
	device has entered the paused state.

   NAME
       MPEGCMD_SETBORDER -- Set display position and border color

   FUNCTION
       MPEGCMD_SETBORDER is used to set the display position and border color
	for the decoded video stream.

	The io_Data field of the IO request must point to a MPEGBorderParams
	structure.   That structure should be set up as follows:

	mbp_LeftBorder  - Offset from left of display (Hi-Res pixels)
	mbp_TopBorder	- Offset from top of display  (NI scanlines)
	mbp_BorderRed	- 8-bit red value for the border color
	mbp_BorderGreen - 8-bit green value for the border color
	mbp_BorderBlue  - 8-bit blue value for the border color

	Values of 0 for mbp_LeftBorder and/or mbp_TopBorder mean that the
	video should be centered horizontally and/or vertically centered
	on the display.

cd32mpeg.device/MPEGCMD_SETWINDOW           cd32mpeg.device/MPEGCMD_SETWINDOW

   NAME
       MPEGCMD_SETWINDOW -- Set portion of MPEG video to display

   FUNCTION
       MPEGCMD_SETWINDOW is used to set the portion of a MPEG video stream
	that will be displayed.  The io_Data parameter must point to a
	MPEGWindowParams structure that contains offset/size information.

	The fields in the MPEGWindowParams structure are used as follows:

	mwp_XOffset - X Offset into the decoded picture for display start
	mwp_YOffset - Y Offset into the decoded picture for display start
	mwp_Width - How wide the displayed portion should be
	mwp_Height - How high the displayed portion should be

	mwp_XOffset and mwp_Width are specified in Amiga Hi-Res pixels.
	mwp_YOffset and mwp_Height are specified in non-interlaced scan
	lines.

	Note: The CL450 is limited to positioning the decode window on
	lo-res pixel boundaries, so mwp_XOffset will be scaled down by
	two.

   INPUTS

cd32mpeg.device/MPEGCMD_SLOWMOTION         cd32mpeg.device/MPEGCMD_SLOWMOTION

   NAME
       MPEGCMD_SLOWMOTION -- Set slow motion playback mode.

   FUNCTION
	MPEGCMD_SLOWMOTION is used to set or clear slow motion playbakc.

	For this command, iomr_Arg1 is used to set the slow-motion frame
	rate.  The display framerate will be equal to (stream frame rate/
	iomr_Arg1).  So a value of 2 would play the stream at half speed,
	4 would be quarter speed, etc.  A value of 0 will clear the slow
	motion mode.  A value of 1 will cause video to play at the normal
	rate, but no audio decoding will occur.

   INPUTS
       mn_ReplyPort - pointer to message port that receives I/O request
                      if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear
       io_Device    - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied
                      from I/O block set by) OpenDevice function
       io_Unit      - unit number to step
       io_Command   - command number for MPEGCMD_SLOWMOTION
	iomr_Arg1    - see above.
       io_Flags     - flags, must be cleared if not used:
                      IOF_QUICK - (CLEAR) reply I/O request

   OUTPUTS
       io_Error     - If non-zero, then an error of some kind occured.
                      See <exec/errors.h> and <devices/mpeg.h> for more

cd32mpeg.device/SetSCR                                 cd32mpeg.device/SetSCR

   NAME
       SetSCR -- Set the current time

   SYNOPSIS
       success = SetSCR(unitPtr, clockValue)
       D0               D0

       BOOL SetSCR(struct Unit *unit, ULONG clockValue);

   FUNCTION
       This call is used to set the MPEG System Clock Reference for a MPEG
       device driver.  This is usually used for synchronizing one device
       driver to another.

   INPUTS
	unit	     - The value in the io_Unit field of the IO request
		       returned by OpenDevice().
       clockValue   - The lower 32 bits of the SCR.  The MPEG clock is
                      specified to be 33 bits, but we only use 32 bits of
                      that clock.

   OUTPUTS
	success	     - Whether or not the clock was set.

   BUGS
	The current hardware has a limitation in that you can only use
	this function to synchronize a raw video stream to another source.
